# Motivations
The codebase contained in this repo is part of a problem set specified by FanXchange.

# Requirements
The code base was constrained to run using `python 2.7` using the standard python libraries.

## Directory structure
The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
fanxchange_text_analysis/
├── README.md
└── app
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── base.py
    ├── data
    │   └── festival.txt
    ├── festival_names.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── word_counter.py
```

## Executing the program
To run the unittest, cd into the `app/` file and for unittests run:

```$ python tests.py```

While to execute the initial applications, run:

```$ python word_counter.py <file_path>```
```$ python festival_names.py <file_path>```

If the file path has not been specified, the `.\data\festival.txt` file will be used instead.
